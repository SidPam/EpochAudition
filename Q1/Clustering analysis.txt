Clustering analysis

To do the analysis of the clustering, I first looked at the format of the dataset
It very closely resembled that of post offices, which also have a system of Circles
However I could not find that many post office details in Karnataka
I looked into both Division as well as District but both have simply too many unique entried which cannot be distinguished by the clustering algorithm
The value of k=17 was picked on visual inspection as lower values seemed to have independent zones within them that were detached from the centroid region
Rainfall maps also didn't match the possible clusters, and nor did election constituencies
But from the clustering results on the map, we can see that top and bottom of the state are missing points, as well as white spaces interspersed across other districts
While there are no clear trends, I can note that the top right, bottom right and bottom left are the most populated zones on the map, followed by a central belt
However on inspection and plenty of google searches, I could unfortunately find no matching criteria to identify what exactly these clusters depict
